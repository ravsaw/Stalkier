# Group-to-Group Interaction Framework

## 1. Group Encounter System

### 1.1 Encounter Detection
- Proximity-based detection in 2D simulation grid
- Territory/path overlap detection
- Scheduled location coincidence (same POI, same time)
- Faction-directed meetings
- Resource competition encounters

### 1.2 Interaction Type Categories
- **Avoidance**: Groups deliberately avoid each other
- **Greeting**: Basic acknowledgment and information exchange
- **Negotiation**: Resolution of competing interests
- **Trading**: Exchange of resources
- **Intimidation**: Show of force to influence behavior
- **Conflict**: Hostile interaction resolved through combat
- **Merger**: Two groups combining into one

### 1.3 Decision Flow
1. Encounter detection occurs
2. Relationship assessment between groups
3. Contextual evaluation (territory, resources, goals)
4. Interaction type selection
5. Interaction resolution
6. Outcome application
7. Relationship update

## 2. Relationship System

### 2.1 Group Relationship Factors
- **Faction Alignment**: Based on faction relationships
- **Leader Relationship**: Personal connection between leaders
- **Historical Interactions**: Past encounters and outcomes
- **Goal Compatibility**: Alignment of current objectives
- **Resource Competition**: Contention over same resources
- **Territorial Overlap**: Competition for same areas

### 2.2 Relationship Tracking
- Persistent relationship values between specific groups
- Influence of faction relationships on group relationships
- Decay/reinforcement over time
- Memory of significant interactions
- Transitive relationships through mutual connections

### 2.3 Relationship Effects
- Determines initial interaction types
- Modifies trade terms and resource sharing
- Affects likelihood of conflict vs. cooperation
- Influences merger possibilities
- Impacts information sharing behavior

## 3. Interaction Implementations

### 3.1 Avoidance Interaction
- Typical when relationship is neutral-negative but not hostile
- When one group fears the other or wants to remain undetected
- Results in path adjustment to minimize contact
- May involve stealth behavior from weaker group
- Can escalate to other interaction types if continued

### 3.2 Greeting Interaction
- Typical when relationship is neutral or positive
- Information exchange about nearby threats/opportunities
- Reputation assessment between groups
- Potential for follow-up interactions (trade, merger)
- Can establish recurring meeting patterns

### 3.3 Negotiation Interaction
- Resolves competing interests without combat
- Resource access agreements
- Territory demarcation
- Safe passage arrangements
- Can result in alliances or ongoing agreements

### 3.4 Trading Interaction
- Exchange of resources between groups
- Value assessment based on group needs
- Haggling system with multiple offers
- Trust building through fair exchanges
- Can become recurring pattern between compatible groups

### 3.5 Intimidation Interaction
- Show of force by stronger group
- Demand for tribute or behavior change
- Territory enforcement
- Can result in submission or escalation to conflict
- Reputation effects spread to other groups

### 3.6 Conflict Interaction
- Full hostility resolution through simulated combat
- Strength assessment of both groups
- Tactical advantages based on terrain/preparation
- Results in casualties, resource transfer, and reputation changes
- Can lead to elimination of weaker group

### 3.7 Merger Interaction
- Two groups combining into one larger group
- Leadership contest between original leaders
- Resource consolidation
- Efficiency benefits but potential cohesion challenges
- Gradual integration of social hierarchies

## 4. Technical Implementation

## 5. Integration with Other Systems

### 5.1 Faction System Integration
- Faction relationships influence group interaction decisions
- Group interactions impact faction-level relationships
- Faction objectives can mandate specific group interactions
- Groups primarily interact with other groups from the same faction

### 5.2 POI System Integration
- POIs serve as common meeting grounds for groups
- Resource competition over POI access creates encounters
- POI control can be contested through group conflicts
- POI reputation affected by group interactions within them

### 5.3 Player Integration
- Player can influence group interactions through reputation
- Player can observe group interactions in world simulation
- Player can participate in/interrupt group interactions
- Player's faction allegiance affects group attitudes

## 6. Implementation Strategy

### 6.1 Development Phases
1. **Basic Encounter Detection** (Days 1-3)
   - Spatial proximity detection
   - Basic avoidance and conflict behaviors
   
2. **Relationship System** (Days 4-6)
   - Relationship tracking between groups
   - Initial relationship calculation
   
3. **Core Interactions** (Days 7-10)
   - Implement greeting interactions
   - Implement basic avoidance
   
4. **Economic Interactions** (Days 11-15)
   - Trading system between groups
   - Resource need identification
   
5. **Conflict System** (Days 16-20)
   - Combat resolution between groups
   - Casualty and resource transfer
   
6. **Complex Interactions** (Days 21-25)
   - Negotiation mechanics
   - Intimidation system
   - Merger logic
   
7. **Testing & Integration** (Days 26-30)
   - System balance testing
   - Integration with other A-Life systems

### 6.2 Performance Considerations
- Only process encounters for active groups near player
- Batch interaction resolutions when multiple happen simultaneously
- Simplify simulation for distant interactions
- Cache relationship values to reduce calculation overhead
- Use simplified models for very large group counts
