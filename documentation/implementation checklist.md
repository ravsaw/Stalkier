## Validation Testing

After implementation, validate with these test scenarios:

1. **Hybrid Simulation Test**
   - Create group of 10 NPCs
   - Track individual need satisfaction during group activities
   - Verify transition between simulation modes based on critical needs

2. **Performance Scaling Test**
   - Gradually increase NPC count from 50 to 500
   - Monitor FPS and memory usage
   - Verify optimization kicks in at appropriate thresholds

3. **Faction Formation Consistency Test**
   - Create multiple faction seeds with similar conditions
   - Verify consistent leadership selection
   - Test ideology consensus algorithms

4. **Cross-System Integration Test**
   - Create scenario spanning all major systems
   - Verify signal propagation between systems
   - Confirm data consistency across system boundaries

## Documentation Best Practices

When further updating project documentation:

1. **Maintain Consistent Terminology**
   - Use "group" consistently (not "party" or "team")
   - Keep consistent names for simulation concepts

2. **Follow Established Models**
   - Use the five-stage faction formation model
   - Reference the three-phase communication implementation

3. **Respect System Boundaries**
   - Clearly document when crossing between systems
   - Use defined integration points for cross-system functionality

4. **Update Integration Documentation**
   - When adding new cross-system functionality, update Section 9
   - Document any new signals or shared data structures

By implementing these enhancements in the suggested order and following the validation testing, the project will maintain consistency across all systems while achieving the goals of emergent faction behavior with 300+ simulated NPCs.
