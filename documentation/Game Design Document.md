**Need Integration with POI Selection**:
```gdscript
# Example of how needs drive POI decisions
func calculate_poi_appeal(npc: NPCData, poi: POI) -> float:
    var appeal_score = 0.0
    var current_needs = npc.get_current_needs()
    
    # Level 1: Physiological needs
    if current_needs.hunger > 0.5:
        appeal_score += poi.has_food_source() * 3.0
    if current_needs.health < 0.7:
        appeal_score += poi.has_medical_facilities() * 2.5
    if current_needs.fatigue > 0.6:
        appeal_score += poi.has_safe_rest_areas() * 2.0
    
    # Level 2: Safety needs
    if current_needs.safety < 0.5:
        appeal_score += poi.security_level * 2.0
        appeal_score += poi.defensive_rating * 1.5
    
    # Level 3: Belonging needs
    if current_needs.belonging < 0.6:
        appeal_score += poi.get_friend_count(npc) * 1.0
        appeal_score += poi.faction_alignment(npc.faction_id) * 1.5
    
    # Level 4: Esteem needs
    if current_needs.esteem < 0.7:
        appeal_score += poi.reputation_opportunities(npc) * 1.0
        appeal_score += poi.leadership_positions_available() * 2.0
    
    # Level 5: Self-Actualization needs
    if current_needs.self_actualization < 0.8:
        appeal_score += poi.matches_ideology(npc.ideology) * 1.5
        appeal_score += poi.offers_skill_development(npc.skills) * 1.0
    
    return appeal_score
```

**Need Conflicts and Prioritization**:
```python
# How NPCs resolve conflicting needs
class NeedConflictResolver:
    def resolve_conflict(self, npc, need_demands):
        # Maslow's hierarchy - lower levels take priority
        priorities = {
            1: 1.0,  # Physiological (highest priority)
            2: 0.8,  # Safety
            3: 0.6,  # Belonging
            4: 0.4,  # Esteem
            5: 0.2   # Self-Actualization (lowest)
        }
        
        # However, extreme neglect of higher needs can override
        for level in [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]:
            need_value = npc.get_need_level(level)
            if need_value < 0.2:  # Extreme deprivation
                priorities[level] *= 2.0  # Double priority
        
        # Choose action that best satisfies highest priority need
        best_action = max(need_demands, 
            key=lambda x: x.satisfaction * priorities[x.need_level])
        
        return best_action
```

**Dynamic Need Evolution**:
- **Satisfaction Thresholds**: NPCs develop higher standards as needs are consistently met
- **Trauma Effects**: Combat/loss can permanently alter need prioritization
- **Social Learning**: NPCs observe others' success and adjust their own needs
- **Faction Influence**: Faction ideology can artificially elevate certain needs

**POI-Specific Need Fulfillment**:
- **Settlements**: Excel at belonging and esteem needs through social interaction
- **Outposts**: Satisfy safety needs but may neglect higher needs
- **Resource Sites**: Fulfill physiological needs but risk safety
- **Neutral Zones**: Balanced but unpredictable need satisfaction
- **Worship Sites**: Unique self-actualization opportunities

### 4.2 Communication Network
- Information propagation speed
- Message reliability
- Faction-based information filtering
- Rumor system affecting reputation

### 4.3 Decision Making Process

**Enhanced Decision-Making with POI Integration**:

1. **Assess Needs & Current State**: 
   - Current POI and satisfaction level
   - Unmet needs that could be satisfied elsewhere
   - Group status and obligations

2. **Generate POI Options**: 
   ```gdscript
   func generate_poi_options(npc: NPCData) -> Array:
       var options = []
       for poi_id in get_accessible_pois(npc):
           var poi = get_poi_data(poi_id)
           var utility = calculate_poi_utility(npc, poi)
           options.append({"poi": poi_id, "utility": utility})
       return options
   ```

3. **POI Selection Algorithm**:
   ```python
   # Multi-factor POI selection
   def select_destination_poi(npc):
       factors = {
           "need_satisfaction": 0.4,    # Can POI fulfill current needs?
           "safety": 0.2,               # Is POI safe for this NPC?
           "social": 0.1,               # Are friends/allies there?
           "economic": 0.2,             # Trading opportunities?
           "faction_control": 0.1       # Is POI controlled by friendly faction?
       }
       
       best_poi = None
       best_score = 0
       
       for poi in get_accessible_pois(npc):
           score = 0
           for factor, weight in factors.items():
               score += calculate_factor_score(npc, poi, factor) * weight
           
           if score > best_score:
               best_score = score
               best_poi = poi
       
       return best_poi
   ```

4. **Group Consensus Building**:
   - If in group, negotiate destination with other members
   - Leader's preferences weighted higher
   - Compromise on POI with sub-objects satisfying all

5. **Execute Decision**: 
   - Set destination POI and travel purpose
   - Join or form travel group
   - Begin journey with route planning

6. **Update State**: 
   - Track journey progress
   - Update POI familiarity
   - Adjust POI preferences based on experiences

**Special Decision Types**:
- **Faction Orders**: Override personal preferences for strategic POIs
- **Emergency Decisions**: Flee to safe POI when threatened
- **Opportunity Decisions**: Change destination mid-journey for better option
- **Social Decisions**: Follow allies/friends to their chosen POI

## 5. Technical Architecture

### 5.1 2D Simulation Layer

**Components**:
- World state manager
- NPC database
- Pathfinding grid
- Event system
- Faction registry

**Update Frequency**:
- Core systems: 5-10 seconds
- Critical events: Immediate
- Background processes: 30-60 seconds

### 5.2 3D Rendering Layer

**Components**:
- **Location Manager**: Handles current active location
- **POI Manager**: Manages POI states and sub-objects
- **NPC Spawning System**: Handles NPC visualization based on 2D positions
- **Transition Manager**: Smooth movement between locations
- **LOD System**: Dynamic detail based on distance

**POI Management**:
```gdscript
# Example POI manager structure
class POIManager:
    var active_pois: Dictionary = {}
    var poi_sub_objects: Dictionary = {}
    
    func update_poi(poi_id: String, poi_data: Dictionary):
        # Update POI state and sub-objects
        if poi_id in active_pois:
            update_existing_poi(poi_id, poi_data)
        else:
            create_poi(poi_id, poi_data)
    
    func manage_sub_objects(poi_id: String):
        # Handle campfires, bars, patrol points, etc.
        var poi = get_poi(poi_id)
        poi.update_sub_objects(poi_data.sub_objects)
```

**Transition System**:
```gdscript
# Location transition with buffer zone
func handle_location_transition(player_position: Vector3):
    var buffer_distance = 100  # Meters before actual boundary
    var current_location = get_current_location()
    var next_location = check_location_boundary(player_position, buffer_distance)
    
    if next_location != current_location:
        begin_location_transition(current_location, next_location)
```

**NPC Visibility Management**:
- NPCs spawn/despawn based on player proximity
- Groups traveling between locations remain visible during transition
- Despawn occurs after true location boundary (hidden from player)
- Sub-object interactions (sitting at campfires, trading) are visualized

**Performance Optimization**:
- POI sub-objects use LOD system
- Distant POIs use simplified representations
- NPC animations simplified based on distance
- Batch updates for multiple NPCs at same POI

### 5.3 Communication Between Layers

**Data Flow**:
1. 2D simulation updates NPC states
2. Location manager requests active NPCs
3. 3D layer spawns/despawns NPCs
4. Player actions sent back to 2D
5. 2D updates affected NPCs

## 6. NPC Systems

### 6.1 Individual NPC Data Structure

```gdscript
# Enhanced NPC data with POI integration
class NPCData:
    var id: String
    var position: Vector2
    var health: int
    var needs: Dictionary
    var personality: Personality
    var faction_id: String
    var group_id: String
    var reputation: ReputationMatrix
    var goals: Array[Goal]
    var relationships: Dictionary
    
    # POI-related data
    var current_poi: String = ""
    var current_sub_object: String = ""  # Campfire, bar, etc.
    var poi_preferences: Dictionary = {
        "settlement": 0.7,
        "outpost": 0.3,
        "resource_site": 0.5,
        "neutral_zone": 0.6,
        "wilderness": 0.2
    }
    var poi_bans: Array[String] = []  # POIs where NPC is banned
    var poi_familiarity: Dictionary = {}  # How well NPC knows each POI
    var preferred_sub_objects: Array = ["campfire", "bar", "merchant"]
    
    # Movement state
    var destination_poi: String = ""
    var travel_purpose: String = ""  # "trade", "patrol", "rest", "explore"
    var arrival_time: float = 0.0
    var departure_time: float = 0.0
```

### 6.2 Behavior State Machine

**Core States & Transitions**:
```gdscript
# Enhanced NPC State Machine
enum NPCState {
    IDLE_AT_POI,           # Resting/socializing at POI
    TRAVELING_TO_POI,      # Moving between POIs
    EXPLORING_POI,         # First time at POI, learning layout
    INTERACTING_SOCIAL,    # Talking, trading, socializing
    WORKING_AT_POI,        # Performing job/role at POI
    DEFENDING_POI,         # Combat/defense actions
    FLEEING_POI,           # Escaping from danger
    WAITING_FOR_GROUP,     # Waiting for travel companions
    LEADING_GROUP,         # Managing group movement
    FOLLOWING_LEADER,      # Following group leader
    NEGOTIATING,           # Diplomatic interactions
    UNCONSCIOUS,           # Injured/knocked out
    DEAD                   # Removed from simulation
}
```

**Detailed State Behaviors**:

**IDLE_AT_POI**:
```gdscript
func handle_idle_at_poi_state(npc: NPCData, delta: float):
    # Check needs and satisfaction
    if npc.needs.hunger > 0.7:
        seek_food_at_poi(npc)
    elif npc.needs.social < 0.5:
        seek_social_interaction(npc)
    elif npc.has_work_assigned():
        transition_to_state(WORKING_AT_POI)
    elif should_leave_poi(npc):
        plan_departure(npc)
        transition_to_state(WAITING_FOR_GROUP)
    else:
        # Wander around POI, use sub-objects
        idle_behavior_at_poi(npc)
```

**TRAVELING_TO_POI**:
```gdscript
func handle_traveling_state(npc: NPCData, delta: float):
    var group = get_group(npc.group_id)
    
    # Check for encounters/events along path
    if check_random_encounter():
        handle_encounter(npc, group)
    
    # Check for dangers/hostiles
    if scan_for_threats(npc.position):
        if group.can_fight():
            transition_to_state(DEFENDING_POI)
        else:
            find_escape_route(npc)
            transition_to_state(FLEEING_POI)
    
    # Normal travel progression
    move_towards_destination(npc, group)
    
    # Arrival check
    if reached_destination(npc):
        transition_to_state(EXPLORING_POI)
```

**Group-Specific States**:

**LEADING_GROUP**:
```gdscript
func handle_leading_group_state(npc: NPCData, delta: float):
    var group = get_group(npc.group_id)
    
    # Make group decisions
    if group.needs_rest():
        find_safe_rest_spot(npc)
        send_group_command("REST")
    elif group.needs_resources():
        evaluate_nearby_pois_for_resources(npc)
    elif group.is_under_threat():
        issue_combat_orders(npc, group)
        transition_to_state(DEFENDING_POI)
    
    # Ensure group cohesion
    maintain_group_formation(npc, group)
    resolve_internal_conflicts(npc, group)
```

**WORKING_AT_POI**:
```gdscript
func handle_working_state(npc: NPCData, delta: float):
    var poi = get_current_poi(npc)
    var job = nbc.assigned_job
    
    match job.type:
        "GUARD":
            perform_patrol_route(npc, job.patrol_points)
            scan_for_threats(npc.position)
        "MERCHANT":
            handle_trade_interactions(npc)
            manage_inventory(npc)
        "WORKER":
            extract_resources(npc, poi)
            build_structures(npc, poi)
        "MEDIC":
            treat_injured_npcs(npc, poi)
            manage_medical_supplies(npc)
    
    # Check work satisfaction
    if get_work_satisfaction(npc) < 0.3:
        consider_quitting_job(npc)
```

**POI-Specific Behaviors**:

**Settlement Behaviors**:
- Browse shops and haggle prices
- Visit taverns for information and socializing
- Participate in local governance meetings
- Establish long-term residence

**Outpost Behaviors**:
- Follow strict military protocols
- Perform scheduled patrols
- Maintain equipment and fortifications
- Coordinate with allied forces

**Resource Site Behaviors**:
- Work in shifts to maximize extraction
- Establish temporary camps
- Negotiate with competing workers
- Deal with site-specific hazards

**State Transition Priorities**:
```python
# Priority system for state transitions
class StateTransitionManager:
    def get_transition_priority(self, from_state, to_state, npc):
        # Survival states always have highest priority
        if to_state in [FLEEING_POI, UNCONSCIOUS]:
            return 1.0
        
        # Combat states high priority but depend on personality
        if to_state == DEFENDING_POI:
            return 0.9 * npc.personality.courage
        
        # Work states depend on needs and contractual obligations
        if to_state == WORKING_AT_POI:
            return 0.7 * npc.get_work_motivation()
        
        # Social states depend on social needs
        if to_state == INTERACTING_SOCIAL:
            return 0.6 * (1.0 - npc.needs.social)
        
        # Default travel states
        if to_state == TRAVELING_TO_POI:
            return 0.5
        
        return 0.3  # Idle states lowest priority
```

**State Memory & Context**:
- NPCs remember previous states for context
- Failed attempts influence future decisions
- Emotional states carried between transitions
- Learning from successful state progressions

### 6.3 Group Formation & Movement

**Group Formation Algorithm**:
```python
# Enhanced pseudocode for group formation with POI destinations
def form_group(initiator_npc):
    potential_members = find_compatible_npcs(initiator_npc)
    target_poi = select_target_poi(initiator_npc)
    
    group_members = [initiator_npc]
    
    for candidate in sorted(potential_members, key=compatibility):
        if can_join_group(candidate, group_members, target_poi):
            # Check if candidate also wants to go to this POI or compatible one
            if candidate.desires_poi(target_poi) or group_has_compatible_goal(candidate):
                group_members.append(candidate)
                if len(group_members) >= optimal_size:
                    break
    
    return create_group(group_members, target_poi)
```

**POI-Based Destinations**:
- Groups form around shared POI destinations
- NPCs with similar POI preferences tend to group together
- Group leaders emerge based on POI knowledge and reputation
- Groups can split when reaching POI if sub-goals differ

**Movement Mechanics**:
```gdscript
# Example group movement to POI
class NPCGroup:
    var destination_poi: String
    var sub_destination: String  # Specific sub-object within POI
    var movement_state: String  # "traveling", "at_poi", "interacting"
    
    func update_movement(delta: float):
        match movement_state:
            "traveling":
                move_towards_poi(destination_poi)
                if reached_poi():
                    movement_state = "at_poi"
            "at_poi":
                select_sub_destination()
                movement_state = "interacting"
            "interacting":
                interact_with_sub_object()
                if interaction_complete():
                    reassess_group_goals()
```

**POI Access & Preferences**:
- Character traits influence POI preferences
  - Traders prefer settlements with markets
  - Warriors favor outposts and conflict zones
  - Scavengers seek resource sites
- POI access control affects group formation
  - Banned NPCs form alternative groups
  - Faction membership influences POI availability
- Groups may form to challenge POI restrictions

**Group Dissolution at POIs**:
- Groups split when individual goals at POI differ
- Some members may stay while others continue journey
- Leadership transitions when group composition changes
- Sub-groups may form within larger POI populations

## 7. POI Management System

### 7.1 POI Architecture & Components

**POI Definition**:
```gdscript
# Enhanced POI structure
class POI extends Node2D:
    var poi_id: String
    var poi_type: String  # settlement, outpost, resource_site, etc.
    var position: Vector2
    var influence_radius: float
    var controlled_by: String  # faction_id or "neutral"
    var population_capacity: int
    var current_population: int
    
    # Sub-objects within POI
    var sub_objects: Dictionary = {
        "campfires": [],
        "merchants": [],
        "workshops": [],
        "defenses": [],
        "storage": [],
        "bars": [],
        "arenas": []
    }
    
    # POI State
    var access_rules: POIAccessRules
    var economic_data: POIEconomics
    var defensive_status: POIDefense
    var event_history: Array[POIEvent]
    var reputation_modifiers: Dictionary
```

### 7.2 POI Control Mechanics

**Control Types & Acquisition**:

**1. Military Conquest**:
```gdscript
# Combat-based POI capture mechanics
class POICombatCapture:
    var control_points: Array = []  # Key locations within POI
    var defenders: Array = []
    var attackers: Array = []
    var capture_progress: Dictionary = {}
    
    func initiate_capture_attempt(attacking_faction: String):
        # Identify key control points
        control_points = identify_strategic_points(poi)
        
        # Assign defenders
        defenders = get_defending_npcs(poi.controlled_by)
        
        # Begin siege
        for point in control_points:
            capture_progress[point.id] = 0.0
    
    func process_capture_tick(delta: float):
        for point in control_points:
            var attackers_at_point = count_attackers_near(point)

- **Seamless Transitions**: Player moves between locations with transition buffer
- **World Border Spawners**: New NPCs enter world at designated spawn points

### 8.2 POI (Points of Interest) System

Each Location contains POIs that serve as major navigation nodes for NPCs:

**POI Types**:
1. **Settlements**: Complex hubs with multiple sub-objects
   - Bars, shops, workshops, residential areas
   - Population: 10-50+ NPCs
2. **Outposts**: Military/defensive installations

   - Population: 5-20 NPCs
3. **Resource Sites**: Specialized extraction/gathering areas
   - Mines, factories, research stations, hunting grounds
   - Variable population based on activity
4. **Neutral Zones**: Open access areas
   - Trading posts, unmarked territories, ruins
   - Dynamic population
5. **Wilderness**: Open areas between POIs
   - Used for travel, ambushes, temporary camps
   - Low population unless events occur

**POI Features**:
- **Sub-objects**: Campfires, bars, arenas, fortifications, patrol points
