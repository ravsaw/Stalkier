        trigger_location_change(new_location)
```

### 5.3 Communication Between Layers

**Data Flow**:

    var personality: Personality
    var faction_id: String
    var group_id: String
    var reputation: ReputationMatrix
    var goals: Array[Goal]
    var relationships: Dictionary
```

### 6.2 Behavior State Machine

**States**:
- Idle/Patrol
- Traveling
- Combat
- Social interaction
- Resource gathering
- Resting

**Transitions**:
- Event-driven (combat, encounters)
- Time-based (rest cycles)
- Need-driven (hunger, safety)
- Social (following leaders)

### 6.3 Group Formation Algorithm

```python
# Pseudocode for group formation
def form_group(initiator_npc):
    potential_members = find_compatible_npcs(initiator_npc)
    group_members = [initiator_npc]
    
    for candidate in sorted(potential_members, key=compatibility):
        if can_join_group(candidate, group_members):
            group_members.append(candidate)
            if len(group_members) >= optimal_size:
                break
    
    return create_group(group_members)
```
